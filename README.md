# IDIA 630 - Information Architecture - VHA

This website was created as part of a group project for a graduate class in the [Interaction Design and Information Architecture](https://www.ubalt.edu/cas/graduate-programs-and-certificates/degree-programs/masters-interaction-design-and-information-architecture) program at the [University of Baltimore](https://www.ubalt.edu/index.cfm).

The site leveraged [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate pages and provide visuals for information architecture recommendations that were shared with the [Veterans Health Administration](https://www.va.gov/health/).

 2. Use the terminal to run `npm install` from the root of the project
 3. Start the project using `npm start`
